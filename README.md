# TrustCast 🔐
### A Trust-Aware Deep Learning Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection in Cybersecurity

---

## 📌 Overview
TrustCast is an intelligent cybersecurity framework designed to detect anomalies in time-series network data and convert anomaly evidence into **dynamic trust scores**. Unlike traditional intrusion detection systems that generate isolated alerts, TrustCast provides a **continuous trust assessment** of network entities, enabling proactive and interpretable security decisions.

The framework integrates **deep learning models**, **VAE-based data augmentation**, and a **trust computation module** to address class imbalance, temporal dependencies, and lack of interpretability in existing systems.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect anomalies in time-series cybersecurity data
- Handle class imbalance using Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
- Model temporal patterns using deep learning architectures
- Convert anomaly scores into interpretable trust values
- Support proactive cybersecurity decision-making
